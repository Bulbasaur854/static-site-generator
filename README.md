# 📝 Static Site Generator

A lightweight Python-based static site generator that converts Markdown files into styled HTML pages. It uses a modular architecture to parse, structure, and render content using customizable templates.

The generator supports 8 types of markdown blocks:
- Paragraph
- Heading
- Code
- Quote
- Unordered List
- Ordered List

Currently supported inline markdown:
- Normal text
- Bold
- Italic
- Links
- Images

⚠️ Markdown parsers often support nested inline elements. For example, you can have a bold word inside of italics:
```markdown
This is an _italic and **bold** word_.
```
This is not implemtneted yet! coming soon...
