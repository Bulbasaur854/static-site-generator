# Static Site Generator
This is a tool to convert Markdown files to an HTML format, and present it as a static website

Currently supported inline markdown:
- Normal text
- Bold
- Italic
- Links
- Images

## Note

Markdown parsers often support nested inline elements. For example, you can have a bold word inside of italics:
```markdown
This is an _italic and **bold** word_.
```
This is not implemtneted yet! coming soon...
